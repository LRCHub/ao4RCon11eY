Late summer in the city,
Just as the night comes around
to my door,
She's somewhere sitting pretty,
She knows we'll soon
Be together once more
It's a happy ending story,
And it's good to know she's
waitin' for me there,
With lovin' to share.
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again,
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
I feel I could be dreamin'
So good to know, that you're
always around,
Works that take so much
believin:
Don't want to lose, everything
that we've found
Everyday that we're together,
Makes me realise more than
you'll ever know,
I can't let you go.
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Everyday that we're together,
Makes me realise more than
you'll ever know,
I can't let you go.
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again)
We fell in love again
Love again
Close eyes count to ten
(Count to ten back again) ...
